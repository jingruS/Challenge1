## Description
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standardsso that the site is optimized for search engines.
I need to replace all the <div> elements with a sytax or with the semantic HTML elements. second, I also need to add an alt attributes in order to make other people know the content of the image even though it's not able to load. Third, I also simplfied code in CSS files by combining two or more elements with the same features with "," in between with different classes.
